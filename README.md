This is the site plan for Electromagnetic Field, and associated GIS data used to produce it.

# Workflow

For those interested, this was produced first by improving the OpenStreetMap data by tracing Bing Maps.
The OSM data was then imported into QGis, reprojected into OSGB coordinates, then exported to dxf.
